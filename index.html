                Uh welp...my name is Ben Clark.  I'm a 25 year old Atlanta transplant beginning his journey into the world of development.
                I hail from Charlotte, North Carolina.  After high school, I went to the great state of Alabama to study Industrial Engineering
                at Auburn University (War Eagle).
                <br />
                <br />
                Post graduation, I accepted an offer from Equifax as an IT Solutions Consultant and, thus, entered the world of Development.
                It was during this role that i gained the exposure to the different roles that make up a development team.  It was after a few years of writing user stories and scrumming it up
                that I decided that I wanted to make the jump from Producy Owner to Developer
                <br />
                <br />
                When I'm not prioritizing the backlog, I can mostly be found at the nearest rooftop bar.  I enjoy sporting and music events on most weekends
                and any of the typical millenial dog friendly venues.
